Schedule Variance (SV) = Earned Value (EV) - Planned Value (PV) → Negative SV signals schedule delays affecting cost.

Involve Stakeholders in Financial Decisions
Keep clients and senior management updated on budget status to align expectations and prevent last-minute cuts.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Comparison of Agile and Waterfall Methodologies
Approach:
Agile follows an iterative and incremental approach, where the project is developed in small cycles (sprints). In contrast, Waterfall follows a linear and sequential process, where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.

Flexibility:
Agile is highly flexible and allows changes in requirements even in later stages. Waterfall, however, is rigid and makes it difficult to incorporate changes once development has started.

Phases:
Agile cycles through repeated iterations, continuously improving the product based on feedback. Waterfall follows a structured process with distinct phases: requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and deployment.

Customer Involvement:
Agile promotes continuous customer involvement throughout the project, ensuring the final product meets expectations. Waterfall has limited customer involvement, primarily at the beginning (requirement gathering) and the end (final delivery).

Delivery:
Agile delivers functional software in frequent iterations, ensuring value is added incrementally. Waterfall delivers the complete product at the end of the development cycle, which can delay the realization of value.

Risk Management:
Agile mitigates risks early by addressing issues as they arise in each sprint. Waterfall has higher risks because problems may only be discovered late in the development process.

Documentation:
Agile emphasizes working software over extensive documentation, making it more lightweight. Waterfall requires comprehensive documentation at each phase to ensure everything is well-documented.

Best Suited For:
Agile is ideal for projects with evolving requirements and fast-changing environments. Waterfall is better suited for projects with clear, stable requirements and industries where strict documentation is necessary.
